                and find a conversation you want to share. The extension adds a "Share" button to the bottom of the conversation.

                From the shared conversation tab, you can copy the address by clicking the <img src="../images/copy.png" class="inline mx-2 rounded" /> button.
                This address can be used by anyone to view the conversation. You can paste this address to share it on social media sites, or
                scroll to the bottom of the conversation and use the social media shortcut buttons.

                        When set, the shared conversation will include your avatar image to represent your side of the conversation. The extension takes a snapshot

                        be visible to anyone that follows the link. To make the
                        conversation not visible to people with the link the
                        conversation must be deleted.

                        Researchers use chat logs to train and test various

                If you share the same conversation multiple times you will get the same address each time. If the conversation changes and you share again, the
                extension will create a new shared conversation with the updated contents. Old shared conversations will not change. The motivation here is
                that links to shared conversations should be permanent.

                Free users have a limit on shared conversations. Once you reach your limit you need to upgrade your account or delete existing
                conversations. Paid users have NO LIMIT to number of conversations shared. If you try to share too many conversations, the extension
                will open the upgrade popup to prompt you to upgrade your account.

            <p class="mt-4 text-base">
                Paid users also unlock bulk download functionality. Paid users can download all their conversations in CSV format for use in
                spreadsheets, or in JSON format for use in other programs.
