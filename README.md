# ShareConversation

Extension to share your ChatGPT conversations and prompts.

Main page is at [ShareConversation.com](https://shareconversation.com/).

Inspired by [ShareGPT](https://github.com/domeccleston/sharegpt), does not share
any code with that project.

## Tech

Backend is Rust with Postgres db. Frontend is JavaScript with Vue. Learning as I go here.

Pieces:
* Extension
    The extension itself is built with JavaScript. It goes through Vite and the CRX plugin. There is
    a "content script" that does the main interaction with OpenAI webpages. There is a "popup" script
    that shows options and has some buttons. This uses Vue. Both communicate with the backend to actually
    do things.
* Backend
    This is a Rust program that runs at `shareconversation.com`. The server talks to a local Postgres database.
    Uses Diesel and Actix as the main technology. Some settings are in environment variables loaded from
    a local `.env` file. The backend also serves HTML conversations (not just JSON results).
* Website
    The main website at `shareconversation.com` is a single-page app using Vue. It talks to the backend
    to do things.

Each piece has it's own `npm` stuff. Even the backend has a build step, then the server serves the bundled
files.

## Database backup/restore

Command to make a snapshot db backup (saved locally in timestamped file):

    ssh root@shareconversation.com "su - postgres -c \"pg_dump --clean sharedprompts\"" > sharedprompts-`date +"%FT%H%M"`.sql

To restore from backup, assuming backup file is locally copied to `~postgres`
location:

    sudo su - postgres -c "psql -d sharedprompts -f sharedprompts-XXX.sql"

WARNING: With the `--clean` in the backup generation, this will wipe the DB and
go directly to backup state. Also note that restoring from backups requires
stopping the backend API server. Can't drop the database until that is done.

## Authentication

The Chrome extension is an "app" in the Chrome developer console so has its own
application id and everything. From within the extension we can access
`chrome.identity` and request authentication tokens. The scopes are controlled
by the manifest file. These tokens are full "access tokens". I don't see a way
to just get id tokens (why???)

To validate access tokens, I use:

    https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/tokeninfo?access_token=...

For the website, there are some Google Identity Services for Web components.
This uses Google Client API JavaScript and shows a "Sign in with Google" button.
The result of this flow is an id token.

To validate the id token you need the Google public keys. Google keys are in
JWKS (JSON Web Key Set) format at:

    https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v3/certs

The server caches them and uses cached values. The server grabs the keys every
few hours whatever the cache control headers say.

I tried to use existing Rust clients for this but was not successful in getting
them to work.

## Package extension

Setup `npm`, then do:

    cd extension
    npm install

To build just for Chrome:

    cd extension
    npm run package_chrome

To build just for Firefox:

    cd extension
    npm run package_firefox

To build for both:

    cd extension
    npm run full_package

That produces the `extension/dist/extension_chrome.zip` for uploading to Google
for Chrome and `extension/dist/extension_firefox.zip` for uploading to Mozilla
for Firefox. For development, you can do:

    BROWSER=chrome npm run dev

If the extension is installed "unpacked" from the `dist/` location then this will do
extension HMR. To get the link working, do "Inspect" on the extension popup window.
This establishes the websocket connection and keeps it open for HMR. Final built
extension doesn't need this.
