# SharePrompts

Extension to share your ChatGPT conversations and prompts.

Inspired by [ShareGPT](https://github.com/domeccleston/sharegpt), does not share any code with that project.

## Tech

Backend is Rust with Postgres db. Frontend is JavaScript. Learning as I go here.


## Database backup/restore

Command to make a snapshot db backup (saved locally in timestamped file):

    ssh root@shareconversation.com "su - postgres -c \"pg_dump --clean sharedprompts\"" > sharedprompts-`date +"%FT%H%M"`.sql

To restore from backup, assuming backup file is locally copied to `/var/lib/postgresql/` location:

    sudo su - postgres
    psql -f sharedprompts-XXX.sql

With the `--clean` in the backup, this will wipe the DB and go directly to backup state.

Also note that restoring from backups requires stopping the backend API server. Can't drop the database until that is done.

## Authentication

The Chrome extension is an "app" in the Chrome developer console so has its own application id and everything. From within the
extension we can access `chrome.identity` and request authentication tokens. The scopes are controlled by the manifest file.
These tokens are full "access tokens". I don't see a way to just get id tokens.

For the website, there are some Google Identity Services for Web components. Basically you load the Google Client API JavaScript
and set up a `div` with some fields and it will make it a nice "Sign in with Google" button. The result of this flow is an access
token.

From there the backend relies on the tokens to authenticate the user. Right now I'm using the API endpoint:

    https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/tokeninfo?access_token=...

This works for the access token, you have to switch it to `id_token` for the GIS flow.

The proper way to do this is to validate the text itself. You can parse the token, then you need to verify the cryptographic
signature. That is complicated by the fact that you need a fresh Google key to do the verification.

Google keys are in JWKS (JSON Web Key Set) format at:

    https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v3/certs

They expire every 5 hours or so. So the server needs to cache them correctly.
